    Compute equilibrium outputs from theoretical formulas.

    From optimality conditions on supply and demand (see technical
    documentation for math formulas), this function computes, for a given
    housing type, the following outputs. First, the demanded dwelling size in
    each place per income group. Then, the bid-rent function / willingness to
    pay (per m² of housing) in each place per income group. By selecting the
    highest bid, we recover the final simulated dwweling size and market rent.
    From there, we also compute the housing supply per unit of available land,
    and the total number of households in each location, per income group.
    To do so, it leverages the equilibrium.sub.functions_solver module.

    Parameters
