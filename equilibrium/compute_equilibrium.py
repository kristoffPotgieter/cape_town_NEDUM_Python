    Run the static equilibrium algorithm.

    This function runs the algorithm described in the technical documentation.
    It starts from arbitrary utility levels, and leverages optimality
    conditions on supply and demand to recover key output variables
    (detailed in equilibrium.sub.compute_outputs). Then, it updates utility
    levels to minimize the error between simulated and target number of
    households per income group. Note that the whole process abstracts from
    formal subsidised housing (fully exogenous in the model), that is added
    to final outputs at the end of the function.
