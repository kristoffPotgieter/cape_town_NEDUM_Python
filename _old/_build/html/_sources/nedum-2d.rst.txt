Overview
--------

**NEDUM-2D** (Non-Equilibrium Dynamic Urban Model) is a tool for simulating land-use patterns across a city in two dimensions. The initial rationale for its development was to make urban simulations more realistic by modelling deviations from theoretical static equilibria caused by inertia in the adaptive behaviour of households and developers over time. The current version developed for the *City of Cape Town* (CoCT) incorporates several transportation modes, employment centres, income groups, and housing types, to provide even more realistic prospective scenarios, while remaining tractable in terms of causal mechanisms at play. It allows to model the spatial impact of policies with a special interest for cities in developing countries, such as informal housing regulation and localized flood protection investments.

Installation
------------

**Step 1**: Git clone **NEDUM-2D** repository in your computer

* Use your terminal and go to a location where you want to store the **NEDUM-2D** model
* Type: ``git clone https://github.com/CIRED/cape_town_NEDUM_Python.git``

**Step 2**: Create a conda environment from the *nedum-2d-env.yml* file

..
	Create the environment file

* The *nedum-2d-env.yml* file is in the **NEDUM-2D** repository
* Use the terminal and go to the **NEDUM-2D** repository stored on your computer
* Type: ``conda env create -f nedum-2d-env.yml``

**Step 3**: Activate the new environment

* The first line of the *.yml* file sets the new environment’s name
* Type: ``conda activate NEDUM-2D``

**Step 4**: Set project directory

* To run properly, the **NEDUM-2D** repository (here, ``code capetown python``) should be included in a project folder that also contains input data, according to the following tree structure (to be updated)::

	.
	├── Data
	│   ├── Precalculated inputs
	│   ├── Aux data
	│   ├── data_Cape_Town
	│   ├── Flood plains - from Claus
	│   ├── Land occupation
	│   ├── precalculated_transport
	│   ├── CT Dwelling type data validation workbook 20201204 v2.xlsx
	│   └── housing_types_grid_sal.xlsx
	├── Output
	└── code capetown python
 
..
	Do we need to set the repo as a project in Spyder?

**Step 5**: Launch **NEDUM-2D**

* Launch from **NEDUM-2D** root folder: ``python project/main.py``
* Use plots scripts for exporting tables and figures in dedicated subfolders under the ``Output`` folder: ``python project/plots_inputs.py``, ``python project/plots_equil.py``, ``python project/plots_simul.py``
* Name of output subfolders vary according to the options selected in the preamble of the ``main.py`` script: see :doc:`../technical_doc` for more details on running custom simulations 

----------
Versioning
----------

..
	Set as default branch

* The ``new_benchmark`` branch contains the latest update of the code and is set as default
* The ``main`` branch contains the original code (with some extra features) from :doc:`../ref_paper` (ported from Matlab to Python)
* The ``TLM-edits`` branch contains some code and folder reorganization without rewriting anything
* The ``TLM-write`` branch contains some rewriting and commenting
* The branches ending in ``_specif`` are tests for several specifications of the code
* All other branches are deprecated
