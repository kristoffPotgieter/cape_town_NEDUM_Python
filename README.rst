Overview
--------

**NEDUM-2D** (Non-Equilibrium Dynamic Urban Model) is a tool for simulating land-use patterns across a city in two dimensions. The initial rationale for its development was to make urban simulations more realistic by modelling deviations from theoretical static equilibria caused by inertia in the adaptive behaviour of households and developers over time. The current version developed for the *City of Cape Town* (CoCT) incorporates several transportation modes, employment centres, income groups, and housing types, to provide even more realistic prospective scenarios, while remaining tractable in terms of causal mechanisms at play. It allows to model the spatial impact of policies with a special interest for cities in developing countries, such as informal housing regulation and localized flood protection investments.

Installation
------------

**Step 1**: Git clone **NEDUM-2D** repository in your computer

* Use your terminal and go to a location where you want to store the **NEDUM-2D** model
* Type: ``git clone https://github.com/CIRED/cape_town_NEDUM_Python.git``

**Step 2**: Create a conda environment from the *nedum-2d-env.yml* file

..
	Create the environment file

* The *nedum-2d-env.yml* file is in the **NEDUM-2D** repository
* Use the terminal and go to the **NEDUM-2D** repository stored on your computer
* Type: ``conda env create -f nedum-2d-env.yml``

**Step 3**: Activate the new environment

* The first line of the *.yml* file sets the new environment’s name
* Type: ``conda activate NEDUM-2D``

**Step 4**: Set project directory

* To run properly, the **NEDUM-2D** repository (here, ``code capetown python``) should be included in a project folder that also contains input data, according to the following tree structure (to be updated)::

	.
	├── 2. Data
	│   ├── 0. Precalculated inputs
	│   ├── Aux data
	│   ├── data_Cape_Town
	│   ├── Flood plains - from Claus
	│   ├── Land occupation
	│   ├── precalculated_transport
	│   ├── CT Dwelling type data validation workbook 20201204 v2.xlsx
	│   └── housing_types_grid_sal.xlsx
	├── 4. Output
	└── code capetown python
 
..
	Do we need to set the repo as a project in Spyder?

**Step 5**: Launch **NEDUM-2D**

* From **NEDUM-2D** root folder, execute the ``main_nb`` notebook (either in .py or .ipynb format) to run the simulations and obtain a preview of results. A non-interactive copy is shown in the documentation for illustrative purposes
* Run one of the plots scripts to export tables and figures in dedicated subfolders under the ``4. Output`` folder
* If needed, run the calibration script to calibrate parameters again if undelrying data has changed
* See :doc:`../technical_doc` for more details on running custom simulations / calibration

----------
Versioning
----------

..
	Set as default branch

* The ``gh_pages`` branch contains the latest update of the code and is set as default. If you want to modify the code, please fork the repository and start from this branch, as this is the one used in this documentation.
* The ``main`` branch contains the original code (with some extra features) from our last paper (ported from Matlab to Python)
* The ``TLM-edits`` branch contains some code and folder reorganization without rewriting anything
* The ``TLM-write`` branch contains some rewriting and commenting
* The branches ending in ``_specif`` are tests for several specifications of the code
* The ``new_benchmark`` branch contains the latest specification before adding the documentation
* All other branches are deprecated

About the authors
-----------------

The development of the **NEDUM-2D** model was initiated at *CIRED* in 2014. Coordinated by Vincent Viguié, it involved over the years, in alphabetic order, Paolo Avner, Stéphane Hallegattte, Charlotte Liotta, Thomas Monnier, Basile Pfeiffer, Claus Rabe, Julie Rozenberg, and Harris Selod.
